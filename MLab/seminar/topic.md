- How does AI documentation differ from other software documentation?
- What are challenges in practice?

Papers:
- Model Cards for Model Reporting ([Paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3287560.3287596))
- Aspirations and Practice of ML Model Documentation: Moving the Needle with Nudging and Traceability ([Paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3544548.3581518))
- Documenting Ethical Considerations in Open Source AI Models ([Paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3674805.3686679))

## Presentation and Discussion Requirements
### General

This is a collaborative effort; ideally, all team members should participate in the presentation.

Your presentation should include:
- 20-minute presentation (including a demo)
- 10-minute discussion

You can use slides and/or any other medium of your choice to visualize your presentation (e.g., a website, or a Figma/Miro project).

You must enrich your presentation with additional papers.

Build on the introductory papers by using resources like Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, or Springer. To download papers from these provider on personal devices, connect to the Informatics VPN or use the lab computers on the ground floor of House D.


### Presentation

Topics. Besides answering the topic-specific questions listed above, your presentation should cover the following:
- What is the core research problem, and why is it significant?
- What are the major recent advancements in the field (last 2-5 years)?
- What future challenges remain?
- How is this topic relevant to app development?

Demo. Prepare a demo to showcase key findings or applications, which may include:
- Showcasing researchers' or your own application as hands-on example
- Multimedia walkthrough (videos, images, brainstorming tools) of a detailed scenario related to your topic
- Ideas to improve your M-Lab app and project based on takeaways from research


### Discussion
Incorporate a discussion with your audience (fellow M-Lab students and supervisors).
Options include:
- Discussion after a full-topic presentation
- Discussion after each presentation section
- Prepared debates based on practical scenarios



## Research Progress Update Session
Objectives:
- Receive feedback: Share your research progress and presentation concepts to gather constructive input.
- Gain inspiration: Learn from other teamsâ€™ ideas and approaches.

Requirements:
- Duration: Prepare a ~6-minute informal update.

Content. Your update should cover topics such as:
- An overview of the research papers you find relevant.
- Key takeaways or insights from these papers.
- Concepts for integrating these insights into a compelling presentation narrative.
- Preliminary ideas for a demo.


Visualization:
- Use any format to illustrate your progress, such as Miro brainstorming map, or a prototype demo.
- Creating slides is optional.


Submission Guidelines

General
- Refer to the Dates section for submission deadlines.
- Submit all deliverables in PDF format to Tim via email.
