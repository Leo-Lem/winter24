\begin{exercise}{Spiking Neural Networks}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Explain the difference between the leaky integrate-and-fire model and the integrate-and-fire model.
    \item Calculate the similarity angle between a weight vector $\mathbf{w} = [1, 2, 3]$ and an input vector $\mathbf{x} = [4, 5, 6]$.
    \item Compute the output of a perceptron with weights $\mathbf{w} = [1, 2, 3]$ and input $\mathbf{x} = [4, 5, 6]$.
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The leaky integrate-and-fire model is an extension of the integrate-and-fire model that includes a leaky term. This term allows the membrane potential of the neuron to decay over time, which can help to model more realistic neuron behavior.
      \item The similarity angle between two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is given by
      \[
        \cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\|}.
      \]
      For $\mathbf{w} = [1, 2, 3]$ and $\mathbf{x} = [4, 5, 6]$, we have
      \[
        \cos(\theta) = \frac{1 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 6}{\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2} \sqrt{4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2}} = \frac{32}{\sqrt{14} \sqrt{77}}.
      \]
      \item The output of a perceptron is given by
      \[
        y = \begin{cases}
          1 & \text{if } \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x} + b > 0, \\
          0 & \text{otherwise}.
        \end{cases}
      \]
      For $\mathbf{w} = [1, 2, 3]$, $\mathbf{x} = [4, 5, 6]$, and $b = 0$, we have
      \[
        y = \begin{cases}
          1 & \text{if } 1 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 6 > 0, \\
          0 & \text{otherwise}.
        \end{cases}

  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Interaural time difference (ITD) is the difference in time it takes for a sound to reach each ear, while interaural level difference (ILD) is the difference in intensity of a sound at each ear. ITD is used for low frequencies, while ILD is used for high frequencies.

  \begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item A cycle graph with arrow labels is a graph where each node is connected to the next node in a cycle, and the arrows indicate the direction of the cycle.
      \item An example of finding the shortest distance between cities by only visiting each city once is the traveling salesman problem.
      \item A recombination and mutation algorithm for the traveling salesman problem could involve recombining the order of cities in two different solutions and mutating the order of cities in a single solution.
      \item Optimization strategies for this algorithm could include using a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of solutions, using local search to improve the quality of solutions, and using elitism to preserve the best solutions.

      \item The three fundamental ANN learning paradigms are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning involves learning from labeled data, unsupervised learning involves learning from unlabeled data, and reinforcement learning involves learning from rewards and punishments.
      \item The learning rate parameter could be chosen using a grid search or random search over a range of values, or by using adaptive learning rate methods like AdaGrad or Adam.
